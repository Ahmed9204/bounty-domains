# bounty-domains

A list of domains eligible for bounties on services like [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/) and [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/).

Especially helpful for seeking potential [subdomain takeovers](https://0xpatrik.com/subdomain-takeover-basics/).

May cause false positive when feeding into automated tools like [subtake](https://github.com/jakejarvis/subtake), but it's a good place to start.
